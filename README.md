# 💼 Personal Project by **Zwixo**

## 🤖 ChatBot (in progress)

This is a **personal project** built by **Zwixo**, focused on creating an intelligent chatbot using **Node.js** and **Express**.

The chatbot is specialized in **CRM** systems.

It uses the **Google Generative AI API** to answer questions only related to:
- CRM automation  
- Workflows  
- Integrations
- Other CRM-related concepts  

If a question is not related to CRM, the bot politely says it can only answer CRM-related topics.

##  Features (so far)
- Trained to answer only CRM questions  
- Strong, educational responses  
- Memory for ongoing conversation  
- Uses **EJS** for front-end rendering

## Status

More details and setup instructions will be added soon.
